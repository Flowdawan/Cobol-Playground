# Cobol Playground

COBOL stands for Common Business Oriented Language. It is imperative, procedural, and object-oriented. COBOL was invented in the late 1950s.

COBOL is a standard language that can be compiled and executed on machines such as IBM AS/400, personal computers, etc.

COBOL was designed for business-oriented applications related to financial domain, defense domain, etc. It can handle huge volumes of data because of its advanced file handling capabilities.

Logical control structures are available in COBOL which makes it easier to read and modify. COBOL has different divisions, so it is easy to debug.

> cobc -x hello.cob
to compile and excecute it for example with:
> ./hello
