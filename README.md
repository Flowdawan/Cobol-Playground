#COBOL Playground

COBOL stands for Common Business Oriented Language. It is imperative, procedural, and object-oriented. COBOL was invented in the late 1950s. COBOL is a standard language that can be compiled and executed on machines such as IBM AS/400, personal computers, etc. COBOL was designed for business-oriented applications related to financial domain, defense domain, etc. It can handle huge volumes of data because of its advanced file handling capabilities.

**My intention** was just to play around with COBOL. So my setup was just Visual Studio Code with a COBOL extension for highlighting

Compiling with wsdl2 on Windows and “gnucobol” installed. Then hitting the command:

    cobc -x hello.cob

to compile and excecute it for example with:

    ./hello
